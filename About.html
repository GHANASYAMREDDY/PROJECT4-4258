            <p class="text"><b>Yaganti </b>This temple is 14 km away from Banaganipalli in kurnool dt. The saint lord Veerabrahmendra swami stayed here for some time and wrote Kalagnanam.[1][2]
                This temple was constructed by King Harihara Bukka Raya of the Sangama Dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century.[citation needed]
                 It was built according to Vaishnavaite traditions.              
                The sage Agastya wanted to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site. 
                 However, the statue that was made could not be installed as the toe nail of the idol got broken. 
                 The sage was upset over this and performed a penance for Shiva. When Shiva appeared, he said the place suits Shiva better as it resembles Kailash.
                 Agastya then requested Shiva to give the devotees a Parvathi Goddess as Lord Uma Maheswara in a single stone, which Shiva obliged.

                Srisailam Sri Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple is located around 180 kilometers from the Kurnool district headquarters, and 213 kilometers from Hyderabad. Pilgrims coming by train would need to alight at the railway station in either Markapur or Tarlupadu. These stations are between 2 and 2.5 hours by road.
                 The Kacheguda-Guntur passenger passes through the Giddalur railway station that is 139 kilometers from the temple.[11]When Shiva and Parvati decided to find suitable brides for their sons.
                 Shiva got Buddhi (intellect) and Siddhi (spiritual power) married to Ganesha.
                 Kartikeya on his return was enraged and went away to stay alone on Mount Krauncha in Palani in the name of Kumara brahmachari.
                 On seeing his father coming over to pacify him, he tried to move to another place, but on the request of the Devas, stayed close by.
                 The place where Shiva and Parvati stayed came to be known as Srisailam.[2]
                As per Hindu legend, the presiding deity in the form of Linga (an iconic form of Shiva) was worshipped with jasmine (locally called in Telugu as Mallika), leading to the name of presiding deity as Mallikarjuna.[3] </p>
